# Predicting-MLB-Salaries-Using-Decision-Trees
1. Developed and evaluated both regression and classification decision tree models to predict player salaries using R's rpart library.
2. Processed major league baseball player statistics, including handling missing values, converting categorical variables to factors, and splitting datasets into training and testing subsets.
3. Trained regression trees to predict salaries using player statistics, and utilized rpart.plot for visualizing decision trees, enabling easy interpretation of the tree structures and feature importance.
4. Evaluated model performance using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and implemented tree pruning to mitigate overfitting, comparing the performance of pruned and unpruned models.
5. Analyzed feature importance by identifying key predictors such as CRBI, CRuns, and Walks, and extracted decision rules from the tree models to provide insights into the most influential variables in predicting outcomes.
